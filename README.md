Some basic features like messaging, posting, notifications are already implemented.
Waiting for realization:
- Things like streaming, video or phone calls will be done with SignalR.
- Images/video/phone calls will be stored in cloud, only the url or path will be stored in the database.
- AI Chatbot with C# or microservice with python?
- Better security, however data encoding/decoding mechanism is complete, there should be a way to use generated keys to create more secure encryptions.
